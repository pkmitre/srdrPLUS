        | The objectives of this database are to: 1. Systematically compile
          and provide access to primary, English-language, peer-reviewed
          science linking dietary fiber intake in humans to one or more of 9
          potential health benefits 2. Provide researchers with a tool to
          understand how different fibers are characterized in studies 3.
          Facilitate researchers in identifying gaps in the current research
          4. Create a database to serve as a starting foundation of primary
          human literature for conducting evidence-based reviews and
          meta-analyses 5. Efficiently assist researchers in identifying
          fibers of interest This database should serve as a foundation for
          future work. Specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, detailed in
          the user manual, were applied in determining database eligibility;
          thus, this database is not intended to serve as a sole source for
          identifying all possible fiber literature for the purposes of
          conducting a meta-analysis or systematic review. This database
          contains Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome (PICO)
          data to help users formulate and narrow the focus of their research
          question. It is expected that secondary searches will be conducted
          to augment this database.
