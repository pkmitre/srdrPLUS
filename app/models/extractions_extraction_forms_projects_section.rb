  # Do not create duplicate Type1 entries.

  # In nested forms, the type1s_attributes hash will have IDs for entries that
  # are being modified (i.e. are tied to an existing record). We want to skip
  # over them. The ones that are lacking an ID entry are entries that are not
  # yet tied to an existing record. For these we check if they already exist
  # (by name and description) and then add to
  # extraction_forms_projects_section.type1s collection. Then call super to
  # update all the attributes of all submitted records.
  #
  # Note: This actually breaks validation. Presumably because validations happen
  #       later, after calling super. This is not a problem since there's
  #       nothing inherently wrong with creating an association between eefps and
  #       type1, where type1 has neither name or nor description.
